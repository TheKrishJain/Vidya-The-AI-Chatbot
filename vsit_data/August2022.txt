NSS BEACHPLEASE!
The youth, with their passion and
awareness on social issues, are
keen to work and inspire others to
work 
towards 
a 
healthy 
and
sustainable future. Kudos to NSS

Beach Clean-ups and Mangroves
Clean-ups 
organized 
by

This was a small but significant
step 
taken 
towards 
the
environment. This helped reduce
waste at the place and to spread
awareness 
about

In our previous event of film appreciation, we learnt
distinct things about films. What is “Film Appreciation”?
Why is it important for students coming from mass
media? How does it help in learning film? We all want
answers to these questions. Let us see what Ashok Rane,
an international film critic and our guest for the event,
had to say about it:
Interviewer: What is film appreciation according
to you and why should students learn it?
Ashok Rane: Film appreciation is important
because it helps us understand the cinema
minutely and very closely. It is something that
tells us more about cultures and sculptures of
our 
country. 
Students 
should 
learn 
film
appreciation so that they know that a film is not
just a film but a story of different characters and
society. A story of different forms of life, a story
of different beings, a story of various parts and
arts of culture.
Interviewer: What motivated you to be a part of
this field / why this field?
Ashok Rane: I have always been interested in
films/cinemas. Since my childhood I have been
watching films and listening to the directors and
stories. As I quote in marathi “Mala ved naahi
aahe, mala cinema pahnyacha shanpana
aahe.” So, for me cinema has always been
something to learn more about every time I
watch one.
Interviewer: Which movie you most enjoyed
working in?
Ashok Rane: I just directed one movie and eight
documentaries, and I must say that I enjoy
making each one of them. Every subject brings a
challenge and to compete it we need to have
preparations. 
Those 
preparations 
are 
your
creativity, 
so 
you 
enjoy 
making 
a
film/documentary.
Interviewer: What do you think are the trends we
have to look out for in national cinema?
Ashok Rane: Indian cinema is changing and now
we are more of a realistic cinema and closer to
life because we are depicting reality but also
making it entertaining. Today’s generation looks
forward to something interesting and funny. 
Film appreciation with Mr.Ashok Rane
In conversation with
Sonali Kulkarni
Interviewer: Does the aura of the set affect
your performance?
Sonali Kulkarni: You have to have your own
ways to be aware of the set's aura. Every
actor has their own ways to cope up with the
negative environment.
Interviewer: How did you get your role in the
Italian movie?
Sonali Kulkarni: They first saw my film
"Cheluvi" at "Cannes Film Festival", in liking to
my performance, they contacted me.
Interviewer: What is your message for the
future generations perceiving to be actors?
Sonali Kulkarni: Watch a lot of films, no
matter what the language. It will help you in
becoming more than just an audience of the
film. Read, write and practice as much as
you can.

This film is an emotional, romantic, action-packed
thrill ride that is also pretty humorous. The last two
Thor films, Thor: Ragnorok and this one, are very
different from the first two; the latter two are much
lighter and, dare we say it, more fun, whereas the
former two are darker but no less fantastic. This
film features an incredible cast, including Chris
Hemsworth and Natalie Portman, among others.
Taika Waititi, who also portrays the movie's
hilarious and outgoing Corg, is the film's director

Like attracts like: It suggests that things or
people with the same energy/ frequency/
wavelength are attracted towards each
other. For example, an individual with self-

Fill the vacuum: Our mind and life is never

important to have thoughts that will be

This can be done by keeping a track of

Dark Academia: 
The Goth aesthetic of art
TOPIC OF INTEREST
PAGE 4
August 2022
An aesthetic is the way of artistically pursuing
life and appreciating it, thereby making it a
lifestyle. Collecting shells and beads and
braiding them into your hair is a way of
appreciating and indulging in the minute beauty
of nature. That was the Boho aesthetic. Like the
boho, there are several other styles that people
pursue (mostly in modern fashion) like Indie Kid,
Grunge, Cottage Core and so on. Among these,
there is one for the library/book enthusiasts
called the Dark Academia. 
The inception and propagation of this aesthetic
is attributed to the novel The Secret History by
Donna Tartt published in 1992. Dark academia is
a subculture that traces the aspects of
education 
and 
languages. 
This 
aesthetic
revolves 
around 
library 
culture 
academic
achievements poetry and literature. It is widely
seen as an aesthetic for introverts. Some Dark
Academia enthusiasts may have a keen interest
in philosophy and languages such as Greek and
Latin as well. It’s fashion consists of black, deep
brown, sap green and carmine hues while the
Light Academia, that is the lighter version of
Dark academia aesthetic, is more towards the
beige and whiter shade.
The remarks of a Dark Academia enthusiast
include aspects such as cluttered rooms, inked
books, 
taste 
in 
classical 
music, 
visiting
museums, libraries and coffee shops.
The term ‘aesthetic’ might have gained a new
meaning these days, however it has always
been an artistic way of living and looking
towards life. Dark Academia is just one of them
that enforces the mysterious and dark art
fanatic within you and makes life more
picturesque.

HOROSCOPE
♈️Aries♈️
What truly makes you happy? What in this
life makes you feel absolutely fulfilled,
blissful, and at peace with the world? Bring
your attention inward this month and
observe what actions give you this good
feeling. It’s important.
♉️Taurus♉️
Take a good look around the room you’re
currently in. What feels “off?” Sometimes we
try 
to 
sweep 
things 
that 
make 
us
uncomfortable under the rug, hoping it fixes
themselves later. Give your living quarters a
good run down. Stagnant energy is asking
to be released.
♊️ Gemini ♊️
Instant manifestation is just not in the cards
for you this month. The practical rituals you
partake in today, tomorrow, and a week
from now, are only stepping stones towards
something greater. Focus on building up
your energy. You can do this!
HOROSCOPE OF THE MONTH:
AUGUST 
♋️ Cancer ♋️
Pay close attention to the direction in which
your resources are flowing this month. Plan
ahead. Do some sleuthing. There are more
machinations behind your money problems
than would normally meet the eye, but with
a little time, you’ll find the truth yourself.
♌️ Leo ♌️
Celebrate all that makes you who you are
this month! It’s not always about the big
parties or the social media views or
whatnot, but this month take the time to
celebrate your efforts and the days you
motivated yourself to get out there and do
your best.
♍️ Virgo ♍️
Head down and elbows up this month. Check
your to-do list morning and night. Take deep
breaths before stretching and tackling the
day. You need your strength to handle the
nonsense 
of 
the 
world. 
Patience 
and
diligence will help you ride any storms that
come your way.
♎️ Libra ♎️
Practice moderation. There could be
many invites to summer parties and
social gatherings, which can be really
great for you, but there may be a
tendency to overdo it, filling you with
regret and anguish later. Rubbing elbows
is great, but be sensible. Ask questions!
♏️ Scorpio ♏️
This is your month. Own it. You are a
brilliant monarch who walks towards
glory and recognition. Build up your
energy, bide your time, then expend it all
at once in a sprint towards your biggest
goal! Go for it. Don’t sit on your hands -
it’s time for action.
♐️ Sagittarius ♐️
It’s time for a new journey. Let this
newest spark carry you to ever greater
heights. It’s more than likely a rekindling
- something you put on the backburner
some time ago in order to focus on
more pressing, immediate matters. Be
excited! And buy a new book!
♑️ Capricorn ♑️
Hang in there. It’s time to put on a calm
demeanor to mask the turbulence within
you as you trudge through the swamps.
It’s not fun. It’s not easy. You might be
met with situations that test you, scare
you, or inspire jealousy or obsession.
Write it out.
♒️ Aquarius ♒️
Other people may be very grating and
disappointing this month. They may not
argue with you outright, but you may
feel unease begin to creep into your
relationships. This could platonic or
work-related, not necessarily romantic.
Reread your contracts, too.
♓️ Pisces ♓️
If you have employees, this could be a
good month to open up to them. There’s
potential for relationship building there.
You may, and I know this sounds silly,
adopt an animal! Take the good with
the bad - there’s bittersweetness on the
horizon. Open up!

Bhivpuri Waterfall
Irshalgad is a mountain located
at the station Chowk. You can
reach here by taking a bus from
Panvel and Karjat. This place
is open to the public the whole
year. On the trek uphill, you
must cross 3 small mountains
and a small village. During
August and September, it’s
mostly foggy and the weather
is chill. There are no shops
uphill, so it’s better advised to
carry your food and water. The

best experience you can have
in your life; the path goes
across the fields and forest with
big trees and small streams of
water.

Bhivpuri is a waterfall located near
Bhivpuri road. You can reach here
by taking an auto-rickshaw or by
walking from the station. This is a
beautiful waterfall between two
mountains. This place is mostly
visited by college students and
families during the monsoon. The
best time to visit these falls is
during August- October when the
water is flowing. You can trek
uphill and enjoy the scenery of the
place. There is a village located
uphill inside the mountains with
clean river water flowing beside.
Downhill near the waterfall, you
can also find small shops selling
water bottles and snacks. The path
toward 
the 
waterfalls

adventurous as you must climb
rocks and cross a small stream of
water.
