Parent Testimonials:

My daughter Simran Khandare was doing post-graduation at Vidyalankar college, Wadala. The college is very good and the education system is excellent. She was pursuing M.Com in Advance Accountancy. Fee Structure is affordable.  The college has very professional faculty members who help students in different context. All the rules and regulations of the college are very nice. The campus is completely clean. The housekeeping staff are constantly working to maintain cleanliness in the college. The infrastructure of the college is excellent.
I understand from my daughter that many events are organized in the college throughout the year viz Verve, Vigour, Inter-Departmental, May-Marathi, Scholar day, Shanivaar Manch, Business mela, Garba night, freshers party, traditional day.
Mr. Mohammad Hakeem
The academic experience with a world class infrastructure and excellent faculty at VSIT college  has endured my child with a lifelong career excellence. The exceptional programmes and teaching methodologies backed by practical skills and industry interface have given the confidence to pursue  career ahead. The all-time support and motivation of the faculty members of VSIT college has enlightened my child and he got direction to his life.
Ms. Karuna Shinde
Campus Life in VSIT is so good that you will never regret your decision of taking admission in this college. It is well-maintained and decorated with lovely flowers. I personally love the plantation methods and it's watering techniques. You will never get bored on this campus. There are so many things that you can go around and do. From playing counter strike to playing outdoor games. Or instead just sit relaxed near the CCD and groove the music with a sip of coffee. Here teachers & students both give equal importance to academics and co-curricular activities. You can experience a balanced life between both. Teaching method in VSIT is truly amazing. Learning was always a fun. The way teachers interact and teach is just wonderful. Both teaching and non-teaching faculties are very helpful and kind.  My overall experience with this college was very nice.
Mr. Bharat Jain
My child's journey in VSIT has not just been for Graduation but also the post graduation as a college we were amazed by the infrastructure as well as the supportive nature of both teaching and non-teaching staff, as parents you barely visit your child's college unless you're called upon but at VSIT teachers were more than happy to share inputs about your child's progress.
Our Child was an introvert and average in studies but since he joined VSIT we have seen him develop inter-personal skills as well as be competitive in academics as well. It is this skill development which he was able to put in practical environment.
